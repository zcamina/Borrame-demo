GIT 

Git is a distributed vesion control system(DVCS) used for tracking changes in sources codes during software development.

Being a distributed vesion vontrol system means that every developer working with a Git repository has full copy of the entire repoditory, including its historyand branches, on their local machine.

Git advantages:
- Offline work. Developers can work on their local copy of the reopository without being connected to a network.
- Redundancy. Each developerÂ´s local repository is a complete backup of the entire project .
- Collaboration. Changes can be shared adn merged between repositories easily.
- Performance. Local repository in Git are usually fast because they are performed on the local copy of the repositor.
